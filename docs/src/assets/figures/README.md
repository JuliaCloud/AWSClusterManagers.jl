The SVG diagrams in this folder were created with [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/).
The saved XML files are included in case you need to modify the diagrams for any reason, but please ensure that you save and copy the XML file for the modified diagram along with the new SVG(s).

The diagrams exported with the `*-light` suffix are exported with "Transparent Background" enabled and "Dark" disabled.
The `*-dark` suffix diagrams are exported with "Transparent Background" enabled and "Dark" enabled.
Note that the "Dark" option only appears if you are using a dark theme in draw.io.
